# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 25/03/2026

### Changed

- Rebuilt the template on top of `Vite 8`, `React 19`, `React Router 7`, `Redux Toolkit 2`, `Bootstrap 5`, and current TypeScript tooling.
- Replaced the legacy CRA and `react-app-rewired` runtime with a modern Vite-based build, preview, and test workflow.
- Migrated application routing to a data-router setup with guarded redirects for guests and authenticated demo sessions.
- Reworked the SCSS theme layer for the current stack and refreshed dashboard, tables, recent posts, quick links, and maps styling.
- Updated the project documentation to reflect the current runtime, demo credentials, optional environment variables, and deployment base path support.

### Added

- Added local demo authentication based on browser session storage with `user / password` credentials.
- Added Redux Toolkit slices for demo posts and UI state.
- Added `Vitest` and Testing Library coverage for session and routing regressions.
- Added accessibility improvements for header and sidebar navigation, including skip-to-content support and improved ARIA labeling.
- Added a keyless maps fallback using embedded OpenStreetMap, with optional Google Maps rendering when `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is configured.

### Removed

- Removed the legacy GraphQL demo backend, old Redux action/reducer structure, browser JWT/polyfill hacks, and other unused CRA-era code paths.
- Removed deprecated or unnecessary dependencies carried over from the previous template implementation.

### Fixed

- Fixed the root route so `/` redirects correctly instead of falling into the 404 page.
- Fixed dashboard widget and table styling regressions introduced during the platform migration.
